# Twitter/X DMs Skill

## Overview
Automates Twitter/X Direct Message operations including sending DMs, managing conversations, handling message requests, and group DM management through browser automation.

## Quick Install

```bash
curl -sSL https://canifi.com/skills/twitter-dms/install.sh | bash
```

Or manually:
```bash
cp -r skills/twitter-dms ~/.canifi/skills/
```

## Setup

Configure via [canifi-env](https://canifi.com/setup/scripts):

```bash
# First, ensure canifi-env is installed:
# curl -sSL https://canifi.com/install.sh | bash

canifi-env set TWITTER_USERNAME "your-username"
canifi-env set TWITTER_PASSWORD "your-password"
```

## Privacy & Authentication

**Your credentials, your choice.** Canifi LifeOS respects your privacy.

### Option 1: Manual Browser Login (Recommended)
If you prefer not to share credentials with Claude Code:
1. Complete the [Browser Automation Setup](/setup/automation) using CDP mode
2. Login to the service manually in the Playwright-controlled Chrome window
3. Claude will use your authenticated session without ever seeing your password

### Option 2: Environment Variables
If you're comfortable sharing credentials, you can store them locally:
```bash
canifi-env set SERVICE_EMAIL "your-email"
canifi-env set SERVICE_PASSWORD "your-password"
```

**Note**: Credentials stored in canifi-env are only accessible locally on your machine and are never transmitted.

## Authentication Flow

## Self-Improvement Instructions
When encountering new X/Twitter DM features:

3. Log successful DM patterns
4. Update for API/UI changes

## Notes
- DMs only possible with users who allow them

- Message requests go to separate folder
- Twitter frequently changes UI/branding
- Rate limits are strictly enforced
- GIF sending uses Twitter's GIF search
