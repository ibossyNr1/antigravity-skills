- When you need to automate content creation from RSS feeds.

2. **Generate (2_3 midjourney .json):** Receives webhook with 4 images, upscales the image selected by user.
3. **Upscaler (3_3 midjourney .json):**  Receives webhook, adds upscaled image to Google Docs.

**Required tools/platforms:**
- make.com
- openai
- userapi.ai
