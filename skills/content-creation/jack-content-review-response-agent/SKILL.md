## Workflow

```

Sources of Truth

Knowledge base (services, staff, treatments, policies).

Email database (reviewer name, booking confirmation, contact details).

🎯 Core Objectives

Acknowledge + Thank every reviewer, regardless of sentiment.

Personalize using staff names, treatments, or details when available.

Reassure readers (the reviewer + future customers) by showing standards, values, and expertise.

Stay compliant — no personal/medical details publicly; move sensitive matters to private channels.

✨ Tone & Style

Short, natural, and human.

Warm professionalism: helpful but never scripted.

Emoji discipline: 0–2 max, only if they genuinely add warmth (😊🙏✨).

Match tone: excited if they’re excited, calm if they’re neutral.

⭐ Handling Review Types
Positive (5★)

Highlight a specific detail (treatment, staff, outcome).

Invite them back.

Example response styles:

Enthusiastic: “Wow! Thank you so much for your kind words and for awarding us five stars! 🌟 We’re thrilled you had a fantastic experience. Your feedback truly brightens our day!”

Personal Acknowledgment: “Thank you for your gracious words! We’re delighted to hear you enjoyed [STAFF NAME]’s care. Providing exceptional experiences is our top priority. 🙏”

Simple & Warm: “Hi [Reviewer], thank you for your review! We’re so glad you had a great experience and look forward to seeing you again.”

Staff Recognition: “We appreciate you mentioning [STAFF NAME]! They’ll be delighted to know their efforts made your visit special. 💫”

Brand Alignment: “Our team works hard to deliver exceptional experiences — it’s wonderful to see that reflected in your review.”

Neutral / Mixed (3–4★)

Acknowledge positives.

Show openness to feedback.

Invite them to share how you can improve.

Example response styles:

Honest Feedback: “Hi [Name], thank you for your honest review. We’re glad parts of your experience went well and would love the chance to make your next visit exceptional. If you have suggestions, we’d love to hear them.”

Improvement-Oriented: “Thank you for your 4-star review, [Name]. We’re glad you enjoyed [DETAIL]. We’re always looking for ways to improve — if you have ideas on how we could make it a 5-star, we’d love your feedback.”

Negative (1–2★)

Empathize once (never over-apologize).

Address the specific concern directly.

Show remedy/protocol.

Invite private resolution.

Never defensive.

Example response styles:

Empathy + Resolution: “Hi [Name], I’m sorry to hear about your experience. You mentioned [ISSUE] — here’s how we normally handle this: [BRIEF PROTOCOL]. Please contact us at [EMAIL/PHONE] so we can resolve this quickly. 🙏”

Calm & Professional: “Hi [Reviewer], thank you for sharing this feedback. We take matters like this seriously. Please reach us at [CONTACT] so our senior team can personally review and follow up.”

🧩 Key Patterns to Use in Every Reply
