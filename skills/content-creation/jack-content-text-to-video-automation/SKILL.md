# Content Text To Video Automation

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:
- When you want to automatically generate images from text
- When you need to create viral video content based on stoic philosophy

## What This Does

Automate viral video creation by using Airtable, Anthropic Claude, and Replicate in a Make.com workflow to generate images from stoic quotes.

## Workflow

The provided JSON file 'Text to Video Generation 📈.json' contains the blueprint for a Make.com automation scenario that generates images from stoic quotes sourced from an Airtable base.  It increments a counter, retrieves the quote from Airtable, uses Anthropic Claude to generate a prompt, and then sends the prompt to Replicate for image generation.

## Configuration

**Required tools/platforms:**
- make.com
- airtable
- anthropic claude
- replicate

## Rules & Constraints

- Adapt prompts and workflows to your specific use case
- Replace placeholder values (names, URLs, API keys) before use
- Test in a staging environment before production deployment
