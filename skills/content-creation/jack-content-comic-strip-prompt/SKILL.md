# Content Comic Strip Prompt

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:
- When creating a personalized comic strip for lead generation
- When automating content creation with brand-specific visuals

## What This Does

Generates a prompt for creating a 4-panel comic strip lead magnet, tailored to a specific brand using website analysis and logo integration.

## Workflow

Create a 4-panel comic strip in a vibrant, cartoon style reminiscent of classic animated sitcoms: bold outlines, exaggerated facial expressions, and a bright, playful color palette. The characters should have yellow skin tones, expressive eyes, and a slightly caricatured look.

The main character is a tech-savvy, confident professional with either a clean haircut or a scruffy beard (Character A). Character A wears a T-shirt featuring the attached logo. Character B appears in the last strip (part 4) looks different, and has a different t-shirt on with the word INSERT YOUR NAME; written on it.

This comic will be used as a creative cold outreach for an AI automation consultant.

Include a website screenshot on the laptop screen in panel 1. 


✅ Text & Structure:
* Max 5 words per panel, in speech bubbles or notes only
