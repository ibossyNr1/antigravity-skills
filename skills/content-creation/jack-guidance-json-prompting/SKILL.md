## Workflow

When using LLMs, provide clear instructions for JSON output:

1.  Specify NO additional information, explanations, or text outside the JSON.
2.  Highlight requirements like starting/ending with `{}` and double quotes.
3.  Provide an example JSON to guide the format and structure.
4. Emphasize the importance of adhering to JSON syntax rules and structure.
