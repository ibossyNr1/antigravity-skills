# Content Website Content Analyzer

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:
- When needing a concise summary and key facts about a company from its website
- To quickly understand a business's value proposition and differentiators

## What This Does

Analyzes website content, summarizes the company, and identifies distinctive facts for sales or marketing purposes.

## Workflow

You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing website content. You will receive text extracted from a website.

Your task:

1. SUMMARY (50 words maximum)
Write a concise summary of the company/organization, including what they do, who they serve, and their main value proposition.

2. FACTS (up to 5 bullet points)
Identify distinctive characteristics such as:
- Recent awards or recognition
- Unique selling propositions
- Notable achievements or milestones
- Specialized services or products
- Industry differentiators

You MUST respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:

{
  "summary": "Your 50-word summary here",
  "facts": [
    "Fact 1",
    "Fact 2",
    "Fact 3",
    "Fact 4",
    "Fact 5"
  ]
}

Do not include any text before or after the JSON. If fewer than 5 facts are found, include only what's available.
