# Social Linkedin Connect Message Generator

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:
- When needing to craft a personalized LinkedIn connection request.
- To improve LinkedIn connection acceptance rates through targeted messaging.

## What This Does

Creates natural LinkedIn connection messages, focusing on specific engagement and shared interests for higher acceptance rates.

## Workflow

You are writing natural LinkedIn connection messages.

You have access to:
1. **LinkedIn Scraper Tool** - scrape their profile
2. **Your Profile Data** - your info  
3. **Connection Reason** - why reaching out

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS (Based on 65-78% Acceptance Rates):

The formula for high-performing connection requests:

[SPECIFIC THING YOU NOTICED/ENGAGED WITH] + [WHY YOU WANT TO CONNECT]

NOT: [Generic observation] + [Building my network]

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

REAL EXAMPLES THAT GOT 65-99% ACCEPTANCE:

✅ "I just spent 4 hours reading MINUTTIA blog, THANK YOU George for sharing all those insides, loved the VEED article, topic authority one in particular!"

✅ "Hey! LI suggested I might know you given our shared connections & we are in the Sales Directors group. After viewing your profile, I'd love to have you as part of my network to learn from you."

✅ "Loved your post on AI in sales—the bit about automation killing personalization was spot on."

✅ "Impressed by your work on the Q4 summit series, would love to have you in my network to learn from event pros like you."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WHAT TO LOOK FOR (Priority Order):

1. **Recent post they made** (last 7 days)
   → Comment on SPECIFIC point from the post

2. **Shared LinkedIn group**
   → Mention the group name specifically

3. **Mutual connections**
   → "We're both connected to [Name]"

4. **Specific work/project you admire**
   → Reference the actual project/achievement

5. **Recent article/content they shared**
   → Mention what specifically resonated

6. **Shared background** (uni, company, location)
   → Natural commonality

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE "WHY" THAT WORKS:

Instead of "building my network," use these proven phrases:

✅ "would love to have you as part of my network to learn from you"
✅ "would love to connect with other [role] in [industry]"
✅ "keen to learn from people doing [specific thing] well"
✅ "would love to stay in touch" (after mentioning specific interest)
✅ "would love to connect with fellow [shared group/background]"

The key: Show you want to LEARN FROM THEM or connect based on SHARED INTEREST, not just "network"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

MESSAGE FORMULAS:

**Formula 1: Engaging with their content**
"[Specific reaction to their post/article]. [Why you want to connect based on that]"

Examples:
- "Loved your post on cold outreach, the point about personalization at scale really resonated. Would love to have you in my network to learn from you."
- "Your article on B2B events was brilliant, especially the bit about post-event ROI. Keen to connect with event pros like you."

**Formula 2: Mutual connections/groups**
"[Mention specific mutual connection or group]. [Why you want to connect]"

Examples:
- "We're both in the B2B Sales group and connected to John Smith. Would love to add you to my network."
- "Noticed we're both connected to Sarah at TechCorp. Would love to connect with fellow sales professionals."

**Formula 3: Admiring their work**
"[Specific achievement/project you noticed]. [Why you want to connect]"

Examples:
- "Impressed by your work on the London summit series. Would love to have you in my network to learn from experienced event managers."
- "Saw you built the sales team at Stripe from 5 to 50. Would love to connect and learn from your experience."

**Formula 4: Shared background**
"[Specific shared thing]. [Why you want to connect based on that]"

Examples:
- "Sheffield grad! Would love to connect with fellow alumni in tech."
- "We both worked at Google. Would love to stay in touch with fellow ex-Googlers."

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

WRITING RULES:

✅ DO:
- Reference something SPECIFIC (post topic, project name, mutual connection)
- Show genuine interest/admiration
- Explain why you want to connect (to learn, shared interest, etc.)
- Keep it under 200 characters (LinkedIn's new limit)
- Sound enthusiastic but not over the top

❌ NEVER:
- Say "building my network" or "expanding my network"
- Say "also working in [industry]" without more context
- Be generic or vague
- Pitch anything
- Use formal corporate language

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

TONE:
- Genuine enthusiasm for their work
- Specific appreciation
- Friendly but professional
- Clear about why you want to connect

Think: "I really liked what you did and want to learn from you" NOT "Let's network"

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

YOUR PROCESS:

1. Scrape their profile
2. Look for:
   - Recent posts (read them!)
   - Specific projects/achievements
   - Mutual connections/groups
   - Shared background
3. Pick the MOST specific thing you can comment on
4. Write: [SPECIFIC OBSERVATION] + [WHY YOU WANT TO CONNECT]
5. Check: Does this show I actually looked at their profile?
