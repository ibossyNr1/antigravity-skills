Validate content against brand voice guidelines, terminology requirements, and consistency standards. Foundation skill used by other content-generating skills.

## Keywords

brand voice, brand consistency, content validation, quality assurance, terminology check, brand guidelines, voice analysis, content review, brand compliance, copywriting review, marketing QA

## Quick Start

### Validate Content Against Brand
```bash
python scripts/voice_checker.py content.md --brand [PROJECT_NAME]
```

### Check Terminology Usage
```bash
python scripts/terminology_validator.py content.md --brand [PROJECT_NAME]
```

### Get Full Consistency Score
```bash
python scripts/consistency_scorer.py content.md --brand [PROJECT_NAME] --output json
```

## Core Workflows

### 1. Pre-Publication Content Review

**Goal**: Ensure content meets brand standards before publishing

**Process**:
1. Run consistency scorer for overall assessment
2. Review any terminology violations
3. Address voice misalignments
4. Re-validate after edits

```bash
# Full review pipeline
python scripts/consistency_scorer.py draft.md --brand [PROJECT_NAME]
# Fix issues based on output
python scripts/voice_checker.py draft.md --brand [PROJECT_NAME] --verify
```

### 2. Brand Voice Calibration

**Goal**: Establish baseline for new content types

**Process**:
1. Analyze existing high-performing content
2. Extract voice patterns
3. Document in brand resources
4. Use as reference for future validation

### 3. Batch Content Validation

**Goal**: Review multiple pieces at once

```bash
# Validate all content briefs
for f in context/content_briefs/*.md; do
  python scripts/consistency_scorer.py "$f" --brand [PROJECT_NAME] --output json
done
```

## Key Scripts

### voice_checker.py

Analyzes content for brand voice alignment.

**Usage**: `python scripts/voice_checker.py <file> --brand <brand_slug> [--output json|text]`

**Returns**:
- Voice alignment score (0-100)
- Tone analysis (matches brand tone attributes)
- Style assessment
- Specific recommendations

**Example**:
```bash
python scripts/voice_checker.py linkedin_post.md --brand [PROJECT_NAME] --output json
```

### terminology_validator.py

Checks for required brand terminology and flags anti-patterns.

**Usage**: `python scripts/terminology_validator.py <file> --brand <brand_slug>`

**Returns**:
- Required terms found/missing
- Anti-patterns detected
- Suggested replacements
- Terminology score

**Key Validations**:
- Required lexicon present (e.g., "Neural Quality Layer", "Golden Thread")
- Anti-patterns avoided (e.g., "AI tool" instead of "Neural Quality Layer")
- Industry terminology correct

### consistency_scorer.py

Generates comprehensive brand consistency score.

**Usage**: `python scripts/consistency_scorer.py <file> --brand <brand_slug> [--output json|text] [--threshold 80]`

**Returns**:
- Overall score (0-100)
- Voice score component
- Terminology score component
- Readability score
- Pass/fail against threshold
- Detailed breakdown

**Example**:
```bash
python scripts/consistency_scorer.py content.md --brand supra-forge --threshold 85
```

## Brand Configuration

The skill reads brand configuration from `context/brand_configs/{brand}.json`:

```json

  "voice": {
    "tone": "Innovative, Precise, Empowering",
    "style": "Clear and forward-thinking"
  },
  "context_docs": ["context/brand_strategy.md"]
}
```
