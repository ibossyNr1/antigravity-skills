# Nocode Install Notebooklm Mcp

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:
- when you want to connect AntiGravity to NotebookLM
- when setting up NotebookLM MCP server

## What This Does

Provides a prompt to install and setup the NotebookLM MCP server using AntiGravity, guiding the user through the process.

## Workflow

Install and set up the NotebookLM MCP server for me:
1. Install the notebooklm-mcp-server package using uv (or pip if uv isn't available)
2. Add it to my MCP configuration file (usually at ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json or similar)
3. Run the authentication command (notebooklm-mcp-auth) and open a browser to authorize it
4. Verify the installation is working by listing my NotebookLM notebooks
Make sure to:
- Use the correct installation method for my system
- Configure the MCP server properly in my config file
- Guide me through the browser authentication process
- Confirm everything is working at the end

## Configuration

**Required tools/platforms:**
- antigravity
- notebooklm

## Rules & Constraints

- Adapt prompts and workflows to your specific use case
- Replace placeholder values (names, URLs, API keys) before use
- Test in a staging environment before production deployment
