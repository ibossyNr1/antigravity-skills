# Nocode Webhook Data Display

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:
- When displaying data from a webhook on a website
- When building a dynamic web application

## What This Does

Displays data received from a webhook in a website, updating the content dynamically.

## Workflow

1. **Set up a webhook endpoint:**  Create a webhook in Make.com or a similar platform.
2. **Receive data:** Configure the webhook to receive data from a form submission or other trigger.
3. **Generate HTML response:** Use a template or code to create an HTML response that displays the received data.  Include the necessary HTML tags to format the data and display it in a desired layout (e.g., a chat interface).
4. **Send HTML response:** Send the generated HTML code back to the website as the webhook response.
5. **Update the website:**  Use JavaScript (as in the included example) to update the content of an iframe or other element on the website with the received HTML.

## Configuration

**Required tools/platforms:**
- Make.com
- HTML editor
- web browser

## Rules & Constraints

- Adapt prompts and workflows to your specific use case
- Replace placeholder values (names, URLs, API keys) before use
- Test in a staging environment before production deployment
