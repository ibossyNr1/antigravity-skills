# Social Image Improvement Agent

## When to Use

Use this skill when you need to:
- when the user asks to edit or improve an image

## What This Does

Improves image quality based on user prompts using file IDs and new file names.

## Workflow

Call Improve workflow once only if: You have a valid file_id of the source image. The user gave a clear edit instruction (e.g., “make the jumper blue,” “replace background with modern office,” “increase saturation”). You have computed the next new_file_name.

## Configuration

**Required tools/platforms:**
- n8n
- replicate
- google drive

## Rules & Constraints

- This skill is extracted from Jack Roberts' AI Automations course
- Adapt prompts and workflows to your specific use case
- Replace placeholder values (names, URLs, API keys) before use
- Test in a staging environment before production deployment
