## What This Does

It uses a webhook to receive messages from Unipile, extracts chat ID and message content, then feeds this information to an AI agent. The AI agent, configured with a system message for a WhatsApp agent role, formulates a response. Finally, the AI agent's response is sent back to the user via Unipile.

- n8n
- Unipile
- OpenAI API Key

## Rules & Constraints

- This skill is extracted from Jack Roberts' AI Automations course

- Replace placeholder values (names, URLs, API keys) before use
